# ProSample

This repository contains the code for a visual demonstration tool for the dynamic sampling pipeline for Progressive Visual Analytics (PVA).
The tool allows to visually compare two pipeline configurations in a side-by-side view, for example to decide on the best sampling configuration for a task at hand or to explore the design space of the sampling pipeline.

The repository contains two main directories: [client/](./client), which contains the web-based frontend, [server/](./server), which contains a and a Python-based backend.
Both components communicate through an eel API.

## Installation
Client and server need to be installed separately.
Follow the instructions in the respective directories for more details.
